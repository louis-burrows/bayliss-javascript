        <div class="service-info">
          With access to over 800 different types of glass, we are able to match existing glass from all periods to ensure the most sympathetic restoration. In addition, we can repair and replace damaged leadwork. Where a repair is simply not possible, we can reproduce existing designs using historic glass and hand painting. We can also repair timber and metal period frames and fittings, or create perfect reproductions to preserve the historic look of a building.
